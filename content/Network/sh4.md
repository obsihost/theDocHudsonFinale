10. <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Within a data classification scheme, "comprehensive" means that an information asset should fit in only one category.</span>
11. <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">A security clearance is a component of a data classification scheme that assigns a status level to systems to designate the maximum level of classified data that may be stored on them.</span>
12. <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">When determining the relative importance of each asset, refer to the organization’s mission statement or statement of objectives to determine which elements are essential, which are supportive, and which are merely adjuncts.</span>
13. <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">When it is necessary to calculate, estimate, or derive values for information assets, you might give consideration to the value incurred from the cost of protecting the information.</span>

16. <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">The threats-vulnerabilities-assets (TVA) worksheet is a document that shows a comparative ranking of prioritized assets against prioritized threats, with an indication of any vulnerabilities in the asset/threat pairings.</span>
17. <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Risk mitigation is the risk treatment strategy that attempts to eliminate or reduce any remaining uncontrolled risk through the application of additional controls and safeguards, but it **is not** the preferred approach to controlling risk.</span>
18. <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">If the acceptance risk treatment strategy is used to handle every vulnerability in the organization, its managers may be unable to conduct proactive security activities and may portray an apathetic approach to security in general.</span>
19. <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">To determine if the risk to an information asset is acceptable or not, you estimate the expected loss the organization will incur if the risk is exploited.</span>
20. <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">In a cost-benefit analysis, a single loss expectancy (SLE) is the calculated value associated with the most likely loss from an attack; the SLE is the product of the asset’s value and the annualized loss expectancy.</span>
21. <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">Some information security experts argue that it is virtually impossible to determine the true value of information and information-bearing assets.</span>
22. <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Cost-benefit analyses (CBAs) cannot be calculated after controls have been functioning for a time, as observation over time prevents precision in evaluating the benefits of the safeguard and determining whether it is functioning as intended.</span>

## **Modified True / False**

5. <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">The RM policy is a strategic document that formalizes much of the intent of the Infosec group.</span>
6. <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Risk acceptance defines the quantity and nature of risk that organizations are willing to accept as they evaluate the trade-offs between perfect security and unlimited accessibility.</span> **Appetite**
7. <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Pervasive risk is the amount of risk that remains to an information asset even after the organization has applied its desired level of controls.</span> **Residual**
8. <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Risk perception is the assessment of the amount of risk an organization is willing to accept for a particular information asset, typically part of the risk appetite.</span> **Tolerance**

11. <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">One way to determine which information assets are valuable is by evaluating which information asset(s) would expose the company to liability or embarrassment if revealed.</span>
