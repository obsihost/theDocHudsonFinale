17. Failure to develop an information security system based on the organization’s mission, vision, and culture guarantees the failure of the information security program.
18. NIST 800-14's Principles for Securing Information Technology Systems can be used to make sure the needed key elements of a successful effort are factored into the design of an information security program and to produce a blueprint for an effective security architecture.
19. NIST Special Publication 800-18 Rev. 1, The Guide for Developing Security Plans for Federal Information Systems, includes templates for major application security plans, and provides detailed methods for assessing, designing, and implementing controls and plans for applications of varying size.
20. In 2016, NIST published a new Federal Master Cybersecurity Framework to create a mandatory framework for managing cybersecurity risk for the delivery of critical infrastructure services at every organization in the United States, based on vendor-specific technologies.
21. Managerial controls set the direction and scope of the security process and provide detailed instructions for its conduct.
22. To achieve defense in depth, an organization must establish multiple layers of security controls and safeguards.
