## Definitions and History

### What is Information Security?
- **Information Security (InfoSec)**: The practice of protecting information and its critical elements (systems, hardware, software) from unauthorized access, modification, or destruction.
- InfoSec incorporates **data security**, **network security**, and **information security management**.
### The Evolution of Computer Security
- **Early Beginnings**:
  - Computer security emerged post-WWII with the advent of mainframes.
  - Initial focus was on **physical security** and **document classification** to prevent equipment theft, espionage, and sabotage.
- **1960s**:
  - Cold War demands led to **more advanced mainframes** and the development of ARPANET by ARPA, laying the foundation for the modern Internet.
- **1970s-1980s**:
  - As ARPANET grew, vulnerabilities surfaced due to limited remote user controls.
  - **RAND Report R-609** expanded security concerns from physical protections to include data security, unauthorized access limitations, and management policies.
- **1990s**:
  - The Internet evolved into a global network, connecting multiple systems with minimal security measures.
  - Organizations began formalizing security efforts, making InfoSec an independent field.
- **2000 to Present**:
  - The Internet enabled widespread communication among unsecured networks.
  - The emergence of sophisticated cyber threats increased awareness of the need for robust security measures, from individual hackers to government-sponsored attacks.
- **MULTICS (Multiplexed Information and Computing Service)**: Early researches of computer security centered in it.
### Key Milestones in Information Security
- **1968**: Maurice Wilkes highlights password security concerns.
- **1970**: RAND Report R-609, authored by Willis H. Ware, addresses security controls for computer systems.
- **1978**: Federal standards examine the Digital Encryption Standard (DES).
- **1982**: Trusted Computer Security Evaluation Center publishes the Rainbow Series, influencing future security frameworks.
## Definitions
### What is Security?
- **Security**: Defined as a "state of being secure and free from danger or harm." Security involves actions taken to protect people, operations, infrastructure, information, and assets.
- Security requires **multiple layers of protections** across various domains, including physical, personal, operations, communications, and information.
### What is Information Security?
- **Information Security (InfoSec)**: Protects information and its critical elements—such as systems, hardware, and software—used for storage, processing, and transmission.
- **C.I.A. Triad**: A foundational model in InfoSec, representing three core principles:
  - **Confidentiality**: Ensures that information is accessible only to authorized individuals.
  - **Integrity**: Maintains the accuracy and reliability of data, preventing unauthorized alterations.
  - **Availability**: Guarantees that authorized users have timely and reliable access to information as needed.
## Key Concepts
### Fundamental Terms in Information Security
- **Access**: The ability of a subject (e.g., user) to interact with an object (e.g., data) by using, modifying, or viewing it.
- **Asset**: Any valuable resource, such as information or systems, requiring protection.
- **Attack**: An intentional or unintentional action that compromises the integrity, confidentiality, or availability of information or systems.
- **Control, Safeguard, or Countermeasure**: Mechanisms, policies, or processes designed to mitigate or prevent security threats, reduce risk, and address vulnerabilities.
- **Exploit**: A specific technique or code that leverages a vulnerability to compromise a system.
- **Exposure**: The condition of being open to potential loss or harm due to security vulnerabilities.
### Risk and Threat Terminology
- **Loss**: An occurrence where an information asset suffers unauthorized access, destruction, or modification, resulting in harm.
- **Protection Profile or Security Posture**: The comprehensive set of controls and safeguards used by an organization to protect its assets.
- **Risk**: The probability of an adverse event impacting assets, potentially causing harm or loss.
- **Threat**: Any potential danger that could exploit vulnerabilities in an asset.
- **Threat Agent**: The specific entity or source of a threat, such as a hacker or natural disaster.
- **Threat Event**: An incident in which a threat is realized, impacting the security of an asset.
- **Threat Source**: A category of entities (people, objects, systems) that represent a danger to assets.
- **Vulnerability**: A flaw or weakness in a system or security measure that exposes it to potential threats or harm.
## Critical Characteristics of Information
### Key Characteristics of Information
- **Confidentiality**: Prevents unauthorized access or disclosure of information.
- **Integrity**: Maintains the wholeness, accuracy, and reliability of information.
- **Availability**: Ensures information is accessible to authorized users when needed.
