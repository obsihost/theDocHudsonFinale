### **The Sequencer’s Role**

The sequencer serves as:

1. A **controller** for generating and managing sequences of transactions.
2. An **arbiter** for sequences running simultaneously, decides which sequence of the running sequences should pass its transactions to the driver.
3. the sequencer_Id is a field assigned by the sequencer to each sequence 
4. within each sequence each transaction is assigned a unique Id
5. so each transaction is uniquelyidentified by the combination of its seq_id and tr_id
6. it is the sequencer responsibility to route the drivers responses correctly to the correct sequence based on the sequence_Id and tr_Id

For this, the sequencer must:

- Send transactions to the **driver**.
- provides implementation of the API 
- Optionally receive feedback from the driver (e.g., when the driver requests the next transaction or sends status updates).

### **3. Why Use an Export?**

The sequencer connects to the **driver** via a TLM interface (typically `uvm_seq_item_pull_imp` in TLM1). The sequencer needs an **export** because the **driver** **calls methods** implemented in the sequencer. Here’s how it works:

1. **Driver Pulls Transactions**:
    - The driver **initiates communication** by pulling transactions from the sequencer via the `default_export`.
    - يعني الدرايفر هو اللي بيبدا التواصل عشان كده ال API Implementation هيكون عند ال sequencer
    - Using an export ensures the sequencer provides the required TLM implementation (`get_next_item()`, `item_done()`, etc.).
    
2. **Driver Requests and Sequencer Responds**:
    - With an **export**, the driver can act as the active entity that makes requests (`seq_item_port.get_next_item()`), and the sequencer fulfills these requests.
    
3. **Bidirectional Communication**:
    - The sequencer provides callbacks (like `item_done()`) so that the driver can notify it when a transaction is complete or needs arbitration.
    - An export allows the driver to trigger these callbacks.

### **5. Summary of Responsibilities**

| Component     | Interface Usage | Role                                                                       |
| ------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Driver**    | Port            | Actively requests transactions from the sequencer.                         |
| **Sequencer** | Export          | Reactively provides transactions to the driver and implements TLM methods. |

### **The Sequence Role**

- just to generate transactions 
- each transaction has a unique tr_id and each sequence has a unique seq_id
- all that done inside the body() task of the sequence class

##### **Mechanism**

- the sequence class generate the transaction inside the body() task and call start_item()
- the start_item() blocks the execution in the body() untill the get_next_item() executed from the run_phase in the driver **this indicates that the driver is ready to receive a transaction**
- the start_item() unblocks and finish_item() executed which sends the transaction to the driver 
- the item_done() in the run_phase at the driver indicates that the driver completed his job 



### **Key Points:**

- The **sequence** is the active component responsible for **generating transactions**.
- The **sequencer** is a reactive component that:
    - **Arbitrates** between sequences (if there are multiple).
    - Passes the **next transaction** to the driver upon request.
- The **driver** is also reactive and:
    - Requests transactions from the sequencer.
    - Drives the transactions to the DUT.

### **Example Flow**

Imagine a testbench with one sequence, one sequencer, and one driver:

1. The **sequence** generates a transaction (e.g., a write operation with specific address/data).
2. The **sequencer** holds the transaction in its queue.
3. The **driver** calls `seq_item_port.get_next_item()` to fetch the transaction.
4. The **driver** processes the transaction (e.g., sends it to the DUT via an interface).
5. Once done, the **driver** calls `item_done()` to notify the sequencer.
6. The sequencer acknowledges and allows the sequence to generate the next transaction.

---

### **Arbitration (When Multiple Sequences Run)**

If multiple sequences are active, the sequencer uses arbitration logic (e.g., round-robin, priority-based) to determine which sequence gets to send its transaction to the driver.

#### **3. `add_typewide_sequence(sequence_x.get_type());`**

- **Purpose:**
    - Registers a **typewide sequence** for this class or component.
    - A **typewide sequence** is a special mechanism in UVM that allows you to associate a default sequence with a sequencer. This sequence will be automatically started when the test begins, unless explicitly overridden.
